# Compumag Team 13: 3D Nonlinear Magnetostatic


## Introduction

The problem[1] is a non linear magnetostatic case with an exciting coil set between two steel channels, and
a steel plate inserted between the channels. The applied coil current is is large enough to saturate the steel.
The goal is to calculate the magnetic flux density at certain points.

The problem exhibits a strong nonlinearity due to the bh curve used in the channels and center plate with a Rayleigh region and saturation:


| BH Curve | Zoomed-om Rayleigh region |
| -------- | --------- |

## Setup

We use second order accuracy.


## Results
