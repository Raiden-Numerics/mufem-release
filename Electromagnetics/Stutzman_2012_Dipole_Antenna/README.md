# Stutzman 2012: Dipole Antenna


## Introduction

The dipole antenna is one of the simplest and most widely used types of antenna
[[1]](#references).
It consists of two thin metallic rods that have a sinusoidal voltage difference
applied between them.
The length of the rods is equal to a quarter of the wavelength at the operating
frequency.
Such antenna produces a torus-like radiation pattern approximating that of an
elementary electric dipole.

## Setup

In our simulation the antenna consists of two perfectly conducting cylinders
(modeled using
[Perfect Electric Conductor Condition](https://raiden-numerics.github.io/mufem-doc/models/electromagnetics/time_harmonic_maxwell/conditions/perfect_electric_conductor_condition.html)),
each with a length of $L=1$ m and a radius of $a=L/20=5$ cm, separated by a
narrow gap of length $l=L/100=1$ cm.
With these geometric parameters, the operating wavelength is approximately
$\lambda=4$ m, corresponding to a frequency of $f=0.0749$ GHz.

The gap acts as the excitation point for the antenna.
The feeding circuit is modeled using a
[Lumped Port Condition](https://raiden-numerics.github.io/mufem-doc/models/electromagnetics/time_harmonic_maxwell/conditions/lumped_port_condition.html)
applied to a flat rectangular strip that connects the two arms of the antenna.

The antenna is surrounded by free space, which is represented in the model by an
enclosing sphere of radius $r=1.5\lambda=6$ m, centered at the origin.
An
[Absorbing Boundary Condition](https://raiden-numerics.github.io/mufem-doc/models/electromagnetics/time_harmonic_maxwell/conditions/absorbing_condition.html)
is applied to the sphere boundary to simulate an infinite domain.

The problem geometry and corresponding mesh are generated in the
[geometry.py](geometry.py) file using the [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) mesh
generator.
To achieve higher precision, we set the maximum size of the mesh elements to
one-fifth of the radiation wavelength $\lambda$:

```py
gmsh.option.setNumber("Mesh.MeshSizeMax", wavelength / 5)
```
Additionally, we employ second-order mesh elements, ensuring at least 12
elements per $2\pi$ radians of the mesh curvature:

```py
gmsh.option.setNumber("Mesh.ElementOrder", 2)
gmsh.option.setNumber("Mesh.HighOrderOptimize", 2)
gmsh.option.setNumber("Mesh.MeshSizeFromCurvature", 12)
```

This approach results in a smoother mesh around the cylindrical arms of the
antenna.

The resulting mesh is illustrated in Fig. 2.

The complete code for the simulation can be found in the [case.py](case.py)
file.
For this simulation, we utilize the
[Time-Harmonic Maxwell Model](https://raiden-numerics.github.io/mufem-doc/models/electromagnetics/time_harmonic_maxwell/time_harmonic_maxwell_model.html)
with a finite element polynomial degree of two for enhanced precision:

```py
model = TimeHarmonicMaxwellModel(
    marker="Domain" @ Vol,
    frequency=0.0749e9,  # [Hz]
    order=2,  # finite element polynomial degree
)
```

We assume that the domain surrounding the antenna is filled with air, which we
simulate using the
[Constant](https://raiden-numerics.github.io/mufem-doc/models/electromagnetics/time_harmonic_maxwell/materials/time_harmonic_maxwell_material_constant.html)
time-harmonic Maxwell material, characterized by the permeability and
permittivity of free space:

```py
material = TimeHarmonicMaxwellGeneralMaterial.Constant(
    name="Air",
    marker="Domain" @ Vol,
)
```

To run the simulation, use the [case.py](case.py) file along with the following
terminal command:

```bash
pymufem case.py
```

## Results

### Electric Field

To visualize the resulting electric field, we export it to a
[VTK](https://vtk.org/) file and then visualize it with
[Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)
using the script from the
[paraview_electric_field.py](paraview_electric_field.py) file.
Figure 3 illustrates the electric field radiated by the antenna.
As can be seen, the field distribution of a dipole antenna closely resembles
that generated by an elementary dipole.

### Radiation pattern

In order to visualize the antenna's radiation pattern, we use the
[Far-Field Radiation Sensor](https://raiden-numerics.github.io/mufem-doc/models/electromagnetics/time_harmonic_maxwell/reports/far_field_radiation_sensor.html)
to generate the far-field data.
We then employ the
[paraview_radiation_pattern.py](paraview_radiation_pattern.py) file to plot it
in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).
As shown Fig. 4, the resulting radiation pattern exhibits a torus-like shape,
characteristic to dipole radiation.

<br/>

To further evaluate how closely the radiation of the dipole antenna resembles
that of an actual dipole, we compare the simulated radiation pattern
cross-sections to the analytical solution for a radiating elementary dipole
[[2]](#references):

```math
    E(\theta,\phi)
    = \left|
        \frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \cos\theta\right)} {\sin\theta}
      \right|,
```

where $\theta$ is the azimuthal angle and $\phi$ is the polar angle.
As shown in Fig. 5., the simulated radiation pattern closely matches the
analytical result.
