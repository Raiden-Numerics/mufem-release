# Stutzman 2012: Dipole Antenna


## Introduction

The dipole antenna is one of the simplest and most widely used types of antenna
[[1]](#references).
It consists of two thin metallic rods that have a sinusoidal voltage difference
applied between them.
The length of the rods is equal to a quarter of the wavelength at the operating
frequency.
Such antenna produces a torus-like radiation pattern approximating that of an
elementary electric dipole.

## Setup

### Dimensions



In our simulation the antenna consists of two perfectly conducting cylinders
(modeled using
[Perfect Electric Conductor Condition](https://raiden-numerics.github.io/mufem-doc/models/electromagnetics/time_harmonic_maxwell/conditions/perfect_electric_conductor_condition.html)),
each with a length of $L=1$ m and a radius of $a=L/20=5$ cm, separated by a
narrow gap of height $h=L/100=1$ cm.
With these geometric parameters, the operating wavelength is approximately
$\lambda=4$ m, corresponding to a frequency of $f=0.0749$ GHz.

The gap acts as the excitation point for the antenna.
The feeding circuit is modeled using a `Lumped Port Condition` applied to a flat
rectangular strip that connects the two arms of the antenna.

The antenna is surrounded by free space, which is represented in the model by an
enclosing sphere of radius $r=1.5\lambda=6$ m, centered at the origin.
An `Absorbing Boundary Condition` is applied to the sphere boundary to simulate
an infinite domain.

The following figures show the resulting mesh.
